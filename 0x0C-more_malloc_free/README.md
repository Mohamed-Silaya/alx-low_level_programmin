#malloc


what is the deffreance between this 
`while (s1[len1] != '\0')
len1++;` 
and this
`while (s1 && s1[len1])
len1++;`

Both of these while loops are used to calculate the length of a string in C. However, they differ in the way they handle the case where the input string is NULL.

The first while loop, while (s1[len1] != '\0') len1++;, checks for a null terminating character in the input string s1, and increments the len1 variable until it reaches the end of the string. This loop assumes that s1 is a null-terminated string and does not check if s1 is NULL. If s1 is NULL, this loop will result in undefined behavior.

The second while loop, while (s1 && s1[len1]) len1++;, checks if the input string s1 is not NULL using a logical AND operator. If s1 is NULL, the loop exits immediately without accessing the s1[len1] element, which would result in a segmentation fault. If s1 is not NULL, the loop checks for a null terminating character in the input string s1, and increments the len1 variable until it reaches the end of the string.

In summary, the main difference between these two while loops is that the second loop checks if the input string is NULL before accessing any of its elements, while the first loop assumes that the input string is not NULL and does not perform this check. It is generally safer to use the second while loop when calculating the length of a string in C, as it avoids potential segmentation faults when the input string is NULL.
