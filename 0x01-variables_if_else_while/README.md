|[0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing](https://github.com/Mohamed-Silaya/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)|This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.|
|[1. The last digit](https://github.com/Mohamed-Silaya/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)|This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.|
|[2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game](https://github.com/Mohamed-Silaya/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c)|Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.|
|[3. alphABET](https://github.com/Mohamed-Silaya/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c)|Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.|
|[4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off](https://github.com/Mohamed-Silaya/alxlow_level_programming/blob/main/0x01variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c)|Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.|
|[5. Numbers](https://github.com/Mohamed-Silaya/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c)|Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.|
|[6. Numberz](https://github.com/Mohamed-Silaya/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)|Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.|
|[7. Smile in the mirror](https://github.com/Mohamed-Silaya/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c)|Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.|
|[8. Hexadecimal](https://github.com/Mohamed-Silaya/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c)|Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.|
|[9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success](https://github.com/Mohamed-Silaya/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c)|Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.|
