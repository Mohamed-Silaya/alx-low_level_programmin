|[0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing](https://github.com/Mohamed-Silaya/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)|This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.|
|[1. The last digit](https://github.com/Mohamed-Silaya/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)|This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.|

|[6. Numberz](https://github.com/Mohamed-Silaya/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)|Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.|

|[9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success](https://github.com/Mohamed-Silaya/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c)|Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.|
|[10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need](https://github.com/Mohamed-Silaya/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c)|Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.|
|[11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do..](https://github.com/Mohamed-Silaya/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c)|Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.|
|[12. Software is eating the World](https://github.com/Mohamed-Silaya/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/102-print_comb5.c)|Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.|
